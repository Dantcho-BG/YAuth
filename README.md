 # YAuth

I started this project only for training and since I'm working on other projects this one is pointless.

The project was supposed to have a basic authentication system with:
- Control Panel
  - Authentication settings
  - Customasible forms (Input Fields)
  - List with registered users
  - Control over registered users
  - Ranks and groups
- Personal profile page
  - Page for editing profile details
  - Friends
  - Messaging
- Pages with forms
  - Register page
  - Login page
  - Forgot password page
  - Reset password page
  
Currently the project has almost 0% of these done, but as I said there is no point for me to work on it anymore.
